# What is it? 

- Git is local and we use it to track those changes.
- Where are we? We call that the "Head" of the branch we are on. 

## How to make a folder have GIT? 

We make a folder and then run 

```
git init *folder name* 
```
from within that directory. 

To check the status of the folder, run

```
git status
```

### Standard commit process

```
git add * 
git commit -m "Hello, world!"
git push
```

- If we commit bad code we can reverse to a previous commit with a rollback. 
- Branches let us jump onto another branch of commits.

We call the main branch either "main" or "master".

### Git vs Github

Essentially, local vs cloud. Remote repositories are where we store our code (examples include github and bitbucket).

### Initialising a git repository

```
type git init *repo name*

```

### Add remote repo with the command line input

1. make folder, add file in it
2. run git init, git add, git commit -m, 
3. Go to github, create a repo. Give it a name and copy the URL.
4. git remote add origin *URL*
5. go back to terminal, tpye, git push origin master/main
